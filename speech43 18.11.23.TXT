The main points for today.

First, once again, I congratulate all Ukrainian sergeants and warrant officers on their professional day! I thank every sergeant and warrant officer who genuinely cares for the soldiers, supports the fighting spirit in their units, and knows how to be leaders for the troops. During the full-scale war, over 13,000 sergeants have been honored with state awards. Yesterday, I signed a decree to award another hundred Ukrainian sergeants – the best, the strongest. I am proud of you all.

Second, for today. Several decisions on sanctions of the National Security and Defense Council have been put into effect. Almost 40 Russian legal entities and over 100 individuals, including those involved in the kidnapping and deportation of Ukrainian children from the occupied territory. Also, individuals who, in various ways, assist Russian terror against Ukraine. We are increasing the pressure of our state on them. Each of them must be accountable for what they have done, and we will not leave any connection of these people with Ukraine.

Third, I want to acknowledge the countries that announced new assistance to our state this week. Germany, Finland, Lithuania – thank you for the new defense packages. Estonia – over the next few years, they will increase security investments in the production of ammunition. And this is important. Norway and the United Kingdom – decisions have been made on new humanitarian packages for Ukraine and Ukrainians. Thank you. We are already preparing new steps – security steps – in the coming weeks. This includes strengthening air defense.

Another thing. Last night, almost 30 'Shaheds' were destroyed in our sky. I thank all the soldiers of mobile fire groups, the aviation of our Air Force, and the anti-aircraft missile troops. Your accuracy, guys, is literally life for Ukraine. As winter approaches, there will be more Russian attempts to make the strikes more powerful. It is crucial for all of us in Ukraine to be one hundred percent effective. Despite all the difficulties. Despite all the fatigue. Despite any attempts to weaken Ukraine. Respect and glory to everyone who fights for the country, everyone who helps and works to ensure that Ukraine can defend and protect its independence. It depends on everyone, on everyone who is resilient. On all who are effective. On each and every one who can add and adds strength and perspective to Ukraine. Please use every opportunity to strengthen the state.

Glory to Ukraine!]
