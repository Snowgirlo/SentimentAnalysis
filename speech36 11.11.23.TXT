Date: [11 November 2023]
Speech Content: [Dear Ukrainian men and women!

Today marks the first anniversary of the liberation of Kherson from Russian occupation. The city-hero. The city-symbol. The city of hope. The city of our people who did not surrender to the enemy force and inspired everyone around us and the whole world with their resistance. These are our blue and yellow flags, which repeatedly proved on the streets of Kherson and in many homes and apartments that Ukraine is one, from the northern border to our sea. These are months without communication, without information, but with faith – faith in Ukraine. These are the efforts of many people who saved, helped, approached... And, of course, these are emotions – special emotions when you see your people are returning, and when you know that Ukraine does not forget about its cities and villages occupied by the enemy, just like about Kherson. The entire south of Ukraine learned last year that Russia never comes "forever," no matter how many times they repeat it. Because Ukraine always returns – always! When we know our goal. When it's a shared goal. When we are united. And when we unite others around the Ukrainian goal. Today is one of the anniversaries that shapes our Ukrainian confidence that we can.

Thanks to the Kherson operation, the right bank of the Dnipro was cleared of the occupant. Our warriors then liberated a significant part of Kherson region, provided additional protection to Mykolaiv, Odesa, and other cities and villages in the south of our state, and solidified Ukraine's success in the battle for the Black Sea. Crimea then in the smiles of the people of Kherson, in the words of joy when they welcomed our soldiers – Crimea also felt its future, saw how close we were.

I am proud of all our warriors – all brigades, every battalion, all soldiers and commanders who fought last year. And everyone who is now leading our state through a difficult, painful, but essential – vitally essential! – marathon to the guaranteed freedom of Ukraine. Independence, which has the power to transcend from generation to generation, is truly achieved in battles, draws energy from the unity of the people, and fortifies its spirit precisely when it hears the gratitude of those liberated from the enemy – those who waited for Ukraine, and whose faith has been fulfilled.

Dear people!

Throughout this year, Russia has been seeking revenge for the freedom of Kherson and our other liberated cities. Daily shelling. Bombs, artillery, rockets... Just from yesterday evening until this morning, almost forty drones and rockets... Ballistic attacks against Kyiv, drones, and rockets against Odesa, Kharkiv region. Deliberate torture by the enemy. Every day! But not a single day of despair for us!

None of us should underestimate the strength of the enemy against us. Ukraine knows that the enemy is not weak, restless. But Ukraine knows how to overcome it! Like last year, Russia seeks to destroy our country, our lives. Like last year, we must destroy the occupier. Ukraine is doing this... And today, dear Ukrainians, please thank those who have put their strength and lives on the line to defend Ukraine and Ukrainians. Those who are fighting now. Those on combat posts now. Those who are training to reinforce combat brigades. And those who are working now to ensure our soldiers have ammunition and weapons, armor and aviation, air defense and electronic warfare... So that we can provide protection to Ukrainians and so that Ukraine can reclaim freedom for its land.

I thank everyone who is currently working in Kherson to protect our people! Thanks to all who are fighting on the left bank of Kherson region for the sake of Ukraine! Thanks to all who defend Ukrainian lives!

Our lives will surely triumph.

Glory to Ukraine!

Dear Ukrainians!

Before the end of this day, a few important things should be said. First – about our Kherson. Today marks the anniversary of the liberation of the city, and I am grateful to everyone who remembers how the people of Kherson resisted the occupiers, awaited the return of the Ukrainian flag, and welcomed our soldiers. I thank everyone who today honored the memory of those who gave their lives for Kherson and for our entire state to be free. It is crucial to remember who and how fought for Ukraine, who and how saved lives and our country. I thank all journalists who remind us of this, and every person who preserves the memory of the liberation of Kherson and the bravery of its residents.

On the eve, I signed a decree on state awards for soldiers and civilians who distinguished themselves there – in the defense of Kherson. Those who fought for the state. Those who assisted in resistance. Those who saved and continue to save lives. And those who are as courageous as the world now knows the courage of Ukrainians. Alongside our soldiers, the decree also honors local government officials. These are people who did not abandon their communities, helped defend against occupiers, assisted in resistance. They treated and continue to treat, organized assistance for those who could not take care of themselves, saved children from deportation, and rescued people from Russian terror. They are saving lives even now, under constant bombings and in the face of ongoing attacks. I thank all of you for your courage and dedication to your work and Ukraine. Thanks to each and every one who stays and works right there – in the communities along the front line.

Of course, our security and defense forces will respond to the Russian army's strikes on Kherson and the villages of Kherson region, just as it always happens. This week has shown that in the Black Sea, in the territory of Crimea, and anywhere else, we will reach the occupier. Glory to all our guys who are bringing justice back to Ukraine in this way!

Secondly, there's something important to say today. I spoke today with President Duda of Poland. A good conversation. I congratulated Andrzej and all Poles on the Independence Day of Poland. This day is as important for Poland as it is for us, Ukrainians. The history of our nations is intertwined, and in this, it reflects the restoration of independence in our states and how we now take care to protect it. Ukraine and Poland must stand together so that our people are always free. I thank Andrzej for his kind words today about Ukraine and Ukrainians. Thank you for the extremely valuable support that Poland provides to our state and people.

And one more thing.

We continue the evacuation of Ukrainian citizens from the Gaza sector. This work has been ongoing literally all day. The number of those successfully rescued changes almost every hour. Already 214 of our people. We are also assisting citizens of Moldova. We expect this number to increase. I thank Defense Intelligence, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ukrainian embassies in the region, and all those who are helping us with this work.

Today, I also held a meeting with international experts regarding negotiations and meetings that can strengthen Ukraine – both our defense and international attention to Ukraine. Every day we add strength to the state.

Glory to our soldiers! Glory to our strong people!

Glory to Ukraine!]
